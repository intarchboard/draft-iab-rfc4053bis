          "body": "Also this touches a bit more on tooling but it still be good to be clear here I think.\n\nWhenever we upload a LS, no matter if incoming or outgoing, into the datatacker an email should go out to all contacts belong to the IETF (either \"From Contacts\" or \"To Contacts\" depending if outgoing or incoming) to acknowledge that the LS was recorded.\n\nHowever, for outgoing LSs sent from the IETF, sometimes LS should only be send to a liaison contact email address. This could be covered by adding a \"To-Liaison-Contact\". If that contact is present/known, the statement will be only directly sent to this address. If not, it will be sent to all address in the \"To-Contacts\".\n\nQuestion is should we also do something similar for incoming LSs sent by another org. Usually there is one person that has send out the LS to someone in the IETF and that person in the IETF uploads the LS to the datatracker. Sometimes there might be others from the same org in cc of that original mail. And sometimes there are more people listed in the LS itself (like in an attached word doc or PDF). I guess somehow we should at least send out a confirmation to everybody who was cc'ed in the initial mail when creating the datatracker record. Again we could use the \"From-Liaison-Contact\" for this. However, using this field would than also mean that a reply would only be set to this set of people as well. But I think that seems actually right to me.\n\nSo in summary, if a LS get recorded a confirmation mail is sent to all email address belong to the IETF-side as well as the \"From/to-Liaison-Contact\" if present. If not present, then the mail is also send to all address in the \"From/To Contacts\". ",

If the receiving body cannot accomplish the request within the stated period, courtesy calls for a response offering a more doable deadline or an alternative course of action.\n\nSection 3 Responsibilities when Receiving a Liaison Statement\nThe urgency of a liaison statement is usually reflected in its deadline. A liaison statement for informational purposes has no deadline; in such a case, a courteous \"thank you\" liaison statement may be sent to inform the sender that the liaison statement was received. A liaison statement specifying a deadline, however, gives the receiver a finite opportunity to influence the activity of another body; if it fails to react in a timely fashion, it may miss the opportunity.\n\n6. Responding to Incoming Liaison Statements\nAny incoming liaison statement that indicates that it is for \"Action\" requires a response by the deadline. It is the responsibility of the (co)chair(s) of the addressed group to ensure that a response is generated by the deadline if a respone is intended.\n\nSection 6.3 Responding to Request for Action\nFor tasks that require a great deal of time, it may be necessary that several liaison statements be sent back to the originating organization to report the status of the work and the anticipated completion time. The first of these liaison statements should be generated by the deadline indicated in the incoming liaison statement.",

IMHO, areas should not send liaisons.\n>    Can the IESG send a liaison that represents its view and not that of the IETF?  And if so, what is the distinction?\n>\n>These are somewhat pointy headed distinctions, but again from time to time they have come up.\n\nAnd further:\n\n>  I think the high order bit here, and it really should be normative in the document, is that when any group is speaking (IAB/IESG/area/wg), especially when stating a position, that position must be properly represented as to what form of consensus it has, and whether it is a position of the IETF.  That latter part is important because the peer organizations may not understand our organization.\n\nS. Moonesamy wrote:\n\n>There is the following sentence in rfc4052bis-00:\n>\n> 'However, if these communications aim to \"represent the IETF\", they must\n>  have consensus, e.g. by being based on an RFC or some other formal statement\n>  by a group within the IETF.'\n>\n>Does that mean that statements discussed and agreed upon within, for example, a working group would be viewed as the position of the IETF Community?\n\nAnd further (after Suresh replied with an exampled):\n\n> The designation of the sender is clearly visible in the above example.  However, the external party may assume that the statement represents the views of the IETF Community.  My mild suggestion is for your colleagues and you to consider that.\n",

I think we do need the ability to send statements from the IETF because that\u2019s what other organizations might expect while IESG might not mean anything to them.
