          "body": "Also this touches a bit more on tooling but it still be good to be clear here I think.\n\nWhenever we upload a LS, no matter if incoming or outgoing, into the datatacker an email should go out to all contacts belong to the IETF (either \"From Contacts\" or \"To Contacts\" depending if outgoing or incoming) to acknowledge that the LS was recorded.\n\nHowever, for outgoing LSs sent from the IETF, sometimes LS should only be send to a liaison contact email address. This could be covered by adding a \"To-Liaison-Contact\". If that contact is present/known, the statement will be only directly sent to this address. If not, it will be sent to all address in the \"To-Contacts\".\n\nQuestion is should we also do something similar for incoming LSs sent by another org. Usually there is one person that has send out the LS to someone in the IETF and that person in the IETF uploads the LS to the datatracker. Sometimes there might be others from the same org in cc of that original mail. And sometimes there are more people listed in the LS itself (like in an attached word doc or PDF). I guess somehow we should at least send out a confirmation to everybody who was cc'ed in the initial mail when creating the datatracker record. Again we could use the \"From-Liaison-Contact\" for this. However, using this field would than also mean that a reply would only be set to this set of people as well. But I think that seems actually right to me.\n\nSo in summary, if a LS get recorded a confirmation mail is sent to all email address belong to the IETF-side as well as the \"From/to-Liaison-Contact\" if present. If not present, then the mail is also send to all address in the \"From/To Contacts\". ",
